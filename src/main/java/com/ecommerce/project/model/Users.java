     Logical Reasons for Unidirectional Relationship:
             In an e-commerce platform, you typically need to know the roles of a user to determine permissions and access levels.
             However, you rarely need to find all users with a specific role directly from the Roles entity.

             Example:
                 When a user logs in, you check their roles to grant access to various parts of the application.
