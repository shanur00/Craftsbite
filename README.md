## overview :

Craftsbite, a web application platform designed to connect homemade businesses and entrepreneurs, such as those offering foods and crafts, with local customers. It provides a dedicated space for lovers of homemade products and aspiring entrepreneurs. The platform addresses the growing interest in homemade goods and the limited market reach of home-based businesses, which often rely on their own platforms or social media. Unlike current online delivery services that primarily serve restaurants, Craftsbite consolidates local handmade food and craft businesses, benefiting both consumers and local entrepreneurs. Craftsbite aims to revolutionize the way local handmade food businesses connect with customers, providing a dedicated platform for homemade food enthusiasts. By leveraging modern web technologies and focusing on user-friendly features, Craftsbite will support the growth and sustainability of local businesses while offering customers a convenient way to explore and enjoy homemade foods and crafts.
